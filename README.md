#Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to produce an analog to websites such as rotten tomatoes. However, it is different in that it utlizes 
both twitter data, and Alchemy API to come up with a score based on sentiment analysis. The UI itself is not much to look at as we were
focused more on creating a functional website for our demo rather than a beautiful one.
